## Describe your work


## Part 1: UML Diagram

Note that you must do two tasks here:

1. Add to your repo a document `UML.png` that is a image of your UML diagram
2. Update the document `OOP-design.md` that describes your OOP design, referencing your document.
3. You will receive feedback on your design in a github issue

For your final submission, please update `UML.png` with the final UML diagram and `OOP-design.md` with your final description. Below describe the major changes you made.

The major change I made was that I did not create a dog creature. I did not have enough time, and I wanted to focus on the other components of the project first. 

## Part 2: Implementation

What level simulation did you achieve

Level : [0,1,2,3,4] <-- choose one!

If you completed Level 4, describe the additional creature you added to the simulation.

I achieved level 3 of the simulation.
